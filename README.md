# Solert

This project started in the RUG Web and Cloud Computing 2016 course. Goal was to create a scalable and fault-tolerant web application.

Used technologies:
 - docker swarm mode
 - vagrant to set up the 3 manager vms
 - Cassandra NoSQL database
 - MongoDB database
 - Play Framework (Scala)

As we had trouble in the project to get Cassandra and Mongo running in a docker cluster with data sharing/sharding, we want other people to know, how we did it.

A good starting point is:
 - Solert/Vagrantfile
 - Report/report.pdf
 

Have fun exploring the repo.
